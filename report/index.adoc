=== Use of AI-Assistants
In this project these AI-assistants were used:

* OpenAI's ChatGPT version 3.5
* GitHub Copilot

The AI-assistants were mainly used for:

* Breaking down code logic. I.g. In order to recreate the Python API controller provided by the course, the code needed to be translated into C#. ChatGPT was a fitting tool for this task, as it could quickly provide translations. 
*Code completions. Github Copilot acted as an extension of IntelliSense, in the sense that it could auto-complete simple pieces of code, such as loops, if-statements, and method signatures.
* Research. ChatGPT was also used to provide a secondary explanation when researching new technologies, in situations were the documentation either was difficult to understand, or if subsidary information was needed. 
* Stacktrace breakdowns. ChatGPT was used to breakdown stracktraces, summarizing the information as well as providing a more user-friendly format to read. 

Downsides of using AI-assistants:

* Both ChatGPT and Github Copilot are flawed, which makes them unreliable tools. Sometimes it would take as much time to doublecheck the output of an assistant as would have to complete the task without it, which defeats the purpose of using them.
